# POLLUTION PREDICTION SYSTEM
1.**Introduction**
  Air pollution is not only a global threat but also an urgent problem for environmental safety and public health. The rapid expansion of cities and industrialization has made this problem even more serious, causing emissions in air, water,and soil to become alarming. Traditional monitoring relies on regular sampling and laboratory testing and often fails to provide the timely and comprehensive information needed for effective air quality management. Therefore, the need for new solutions to solve this problem is increasing.

This article explains the use of new methods in pollution control facilities as a solution. Combining advanced technology with advanced learning systems, these centers have the potential to revolutionize climate monitoring applications. This approach will provide immediate and accurate information needed to make informed decisions about pollution reduction strategies.

4. **Literature Review**

In one study, the above model was used to estimate the amount of pollutants in air, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon black (BC). methane. (CH4), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and ozone (O3), etc.
Create a regression model by dividing the day into three periods: 06:00 - 10:00, 10:00 - 14:00, 14:00 - 19:00 Try using descriptive tools for data collection right now Analysis using predictive analytics Make future planning predictions.
This approach allows a comprehensive analysis of pollution levels over different time periods, providing insight into physical changes and their underlying patterns. Using descriptive and predictive analysis, this study aims to not only describe the current situation but also predict future trends to support decision-making on air quality and mitigation strategies.

i)Spatial Service:  Many weather stations have limited service, especially in rural and remote areas. There may be differences in monitoring data, resulting in missing climate measurements in some areas. The development of a distributed network of monitoring stations combined with mobile monitoring tools could help close this gap.

ii)Temporal resolution:  Current monitoring systems often provide data averaged over very long periods of time (such as hourly or daily averages). However, the amount of air pollution can vary greatly during the day due to special conditions (such as traffic, business activities). Improving the physical resolution of data monitoring, for example by providing instantaneous or proximate measurements, allows for more accurate assessment of short-term exposures and timely intervention.

iii)Pollution:  Although there are many networks that monitor pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2 and O3, they are less effective in monitoring other pollutants of concern such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals. There may be gaps in the resulting disease). More comprehensive monitoring of air pollution leads to a better understanding of air quality and its impact on human health and the environment.

iv)Data integration and standardization:  Air pollution monitoring data is often collected by different organizations and organizations using different measurements and tools. As a result, integrating and synthesizing data from multiple sources can be difficult, leading to conflict and ambiguity in the interpretation of data. Creating custom processes and data feedback for air quality monitoring can facilitate data integration and cross-platform collaboration.

v)Model Validation and Uncertainty Assessment:  The forecast model used for air quality forecasting and analysis will be limited to model validation and uncertainty assessment. The assessment is unclear. Uncertainties in input data, model parameters, and model assumptions affect the accuracy and reliability of model predictions. Developing effective models and performing uncertainty assessments can improve the reliability and effectiveness of air quality models.

vi)Integration of New Science:  Advances in electronics, remote sensing, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide opportunities to improve air quality standards and weather monitoring capabilities. However, there may be difficulties in integrating these new technologies into existing monitoring networks and models and ensuring data quality and reliability. Finding new ways to integrate new technologies could help fill the gap in climate monitoring.

In the future, we aim to use the collected data to perform predictive analysis to predict hotspots requiring pollution measures. By analyzing historical data on air pollution, weather and geography, we can identify areas where air pollution may have increased. This positive approach leads to effective plans to reduce pollution, improve resource allocation and protect public health. Through forecasting, we can prioritize pollution control and solve environmental problems before they arise, thus promoting sustainable development and the health of society.
